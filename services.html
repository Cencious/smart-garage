                            Suspension is the system of tires, tire air, springs, shock absorbers and linkages that
                            connects a vehicle to its wheels and allows relative motion between the two.
                            Some shock absorber manufacturers say you should replace them at 50,000 miles, but
                            that is more for their benefit than yours.

                            Instead of using time or mileage to decide when to replace shocks, use them as guides for
                            when to have your entire suspension inspected for wear, damage and leaks. Some shock

                            When is it time to add or replace the refrigerant? If your AC is losing its potency, even
                            after topping it off, then you probably
                            have a leak. But if you stay as a cool as a cucumber on the hottest days, you could just
                            leave well enough alone. The air conditioner obviously has enough refrigerant.
